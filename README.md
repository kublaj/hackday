## To concentrate on: 
More continuity between the morning and the afternoon. Preferably even working on the same code.
What do we want people to have left understanding?


## To Think about:
Do we want to plant a few FAC students/mentors as attendees so they can ask questions that other people may be too scared to ask?
Should we open up Node Girls for Non-binary individuals? 
Should we have a mentors meeting a few days before the event/an hour before the event?
